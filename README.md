### Notes

The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks
depend on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The `requirements-gpu.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks
depend on for training models with cuda GPU-accelerations, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt
```

### To execute the code, run the jupyter notebook file.
